turbo-shame
===========

There was a time in which @gedankenstuecke and me wanted to get into bioinformatics, so we asked if we could do a summer-project. This must've been around ~~2006~~2008 and neither of us could code.

These are the scripts I still had flying around in 2014; it serves as a reminder how far we've come in terms of programming. Some obvious offenders are variables in German, needless repetition of code, the complete ignorance of BioPython and the standard library etc. The project itself wasn't that complicated, just translation of nucleotides and checking of all reading frames (if I remember correctly).

Since this serves as more of a lesson it's in the Public Domain. The awesome and fitting name "turbo-shame" was proposed by GitHub's automatic naming system.
